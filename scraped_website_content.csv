"Optimization Of Scilab Instances On Server | FOSSEE FOSSEE | Home User banner adv Home Statistics About Contact FOSSEE Club FOSSEE Awards Testimonials Resources Teaching Support Join Us Internships Winter Internship FOSSEE ICFOSS Internship Semester-Long Internships Summer Fellowship GIS Internship Events Podcasts Optimization Of Scilab Instances On Server Submitted by Ulfa on Tue, 07/18/2017 - 12:08 The project is about optimizing http://cloud.scilab.in/ to reduce total response time experienced by users after hitting execute button. In existing implementation, a scilab instance is created for each user request which loads all scilab libraries in the background while executing the script from the website. All Users experience delay to get output due to the load time required for these libraries. Scilab instances are terminated after the execution is completed. The major idea of this project was to avoid the creation of scilab instance and hence load scilab libraries for each user request. The proposed solution was to have running scilab instances available to cater to user’s requests. The implementation of proposed solution was achieved via the two stages given below. Stage1: We kept the scilab instances alive and running in the server using pexpect. Pexpect is a pure python module. Loading of scilab instances for each request is being avoided by using pexpect. Stage2: Creation of additional Scilab instances are done dynamic based on the load on the server. If the load on the server is low, the only minimum number of scilab instances are made available to run scripts. Here is an example to explain the scenario, suppose 4 scilab instances are available and all these 4 are busy then a new request comes from a user. In this case, proposed implementation spawn (create) new scilab instance and assign it to the new request. The server can now handle 5 requests at a time. This process goes on until a fixed scilab instances indicating maximum allowed number of instances are being spawned. This number is set based on hardware availability of the server. What happens in the case when there are no users accessing the website? Well, in cases like this, many of the active scilab instances are residing in the server without any work. We implemented an infinite thread (method) running in the back end to check the number of scilab instances working in the server and the number that are idle. This method then kills the scilab instances which are not working and does the same for the next interval as well. This process goes on until there is only one scilab instance in the server because we are assuming that anytime any user can access our website. This way the memory efficiency and speed are achieved in our project. Mentor’s View It was a great pleasure to know and work with my interns Divakar, Meghana and Sumanth. They achieved the project objective of optimizing code execution on http://cloud.scilab.in/ with an overall decrease in execution time and improve execution efficiency on the server. I would also like to thank the Python team at FOSSEE, especially Ankit J and Mahesh Gudi for their timely feedback and ideas on the project. - Arun KP (Project Research Engineer, FOSSEE , IIT Bombay) FOSSEE intern: “IIT Bombay changed my life.

"DWSIM - A Chemical Process Simulator | FOSSEE FOSSEE | Home User banner adv Home Statistics About Contact FOSSEE Club FOSSEE Awards Testimonials Resources Teaching Support Join Us Internships Winter Internship FOSSEE ICFOSS Internship Semester-Long Internships Summer Fellowship GIS Internship Events Podcasts DWSIM - A Chemical Process Simulator Submitted by prabhakar on Tue, 07/28/2015 - 14:56 DWSIM is an open source chemical engineering process simulator. DWSIM compares well with the capabilities of commercial simulation packages. DWSIM has been built on .NET and DWSIM runs on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. DWSIM is CAPE-OPEN compliant and has an excellent thermodynamic package. DWSIM has several unit operations such as - Mixer, Splitter, Separator, Pump, Compressor, Expander, Heater, Cooler, Valve, Pipe Segment, Shortcut Column, Heat Exchangers, Reactors, Component Separator, Orifice Plate, Distillation/Absorption Columns, Solids Separator and Cake Filter. One can combine the above unit operations to simulate many a chemical plants. When compared to results from any proven commercial software DWSIM gives identical results. Results given by DWSIM also match with actual plant results. DWSIM has a sequential modular approach, that is inputs have to be given and outputs are calculated. An utility called 'ADJUST' can be used where trial and error approach can be used to calculate input values. DWSIM an use ADJUST to solve design problems too. DWSIM comes with excellent graph plotting capabilities which can check if thermodynamic package is appropriate. DWSIM can be used to custom build an unit operation, thus overcoming absence of specialized modules. prabhakar's blog Log in to post comments POSTER BROCHURE CONTACT FOSSEE, IIT Bombay Mumbai, India Phone : (+91) 22 25764111 Email : info [at] fossee [dot] in This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License",https://fossee.in/node/27

"Open Sky Planetarium | FOSSEE FOSSEE | Home User banner adv Home Statistics About Contact FOSSEE Club FOSSEE Awards Testimonials Resources Teaching Support Join Us Internships Winter Internship FOSSEE ICFOSS Internship Semester-Long Internships Summer Fellowship GIS Internship Events Podcasts Open Sky Planetarium Submitted by Ulfa on Mon, 07/24/2017 - 17:34 About Project: This is a novel project which aims at providing access to low-cost planetariums, especially to schools. The idea is to control a laser pointing device which flashes a laser beam at the night sky, guiding the position of the object of interest in the sky. So unlike the usual planetariums, there is no dome screen. The actual night sky is used as a dome screen. The laser pointing device is interfaced to and commanded using Stellarium, an open source planetarium software, using a software plug-in created by our team. It also helps play an audio script describing the stars and their patterns in the sky along with the associated stories. Thus, a moving laser beam along with the related audio can facilitate a one man show for the school teachers or demonstrators at an affordable price. Mentor’s View: “The project had a total of three interns, divided as two interns for hardware team and one intern for software team. Jaideep and Ram Mohan were a part of the hardware team. Saloni Mudra was the only software intern. They were a lot of help to come up with new innovative ideas and also to implement the planned ideas seamlessly. The hardware team build circuits and proposed some rather easy solutions to existing problems and shortcomings. The software team implemented new functionalities to suite the hardware design and also to operate the device with much ease. - Rupak Rokade (Assistant Project Manager at FOSSEE) FOSSEE Intern: “I learnt a lot of new things as part of my Summer internship at FOSSEE . Not only did it provide me a platform to learn new tools and technologies, but also taught me some crucial social skills of teamwork and collaboration.” - Saloni Mudra ( Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology ) “A very interesting idea with noble motive ” - Ram Mohan Kumar ( IIT BHU ) Ulfa's blog Log in to post comments POSTER BROCHURE CONTACT FOSSEE, IIT Bombay Mumbai, India Phone : (+91) 22 25764111 Email : info [at] fossee [dot] in This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License",https://fossee.in/node/36

"List of tasks offered under FOSSEE Summer Fellowship 2018 | FOSSEE FOSSEE | Home User banner adv Home Statistics About Contact FOSSEE Club FOSSEE Awards Testimonials Resources Teaching Support Join Us Internships Winter Internship FOSSEE ICFOSS Internship Semester-Long Internships Summer Fellowship GIS Internship Events Podcasts List of tasks offered under FOSSEE Summer Fellowship 2018 Xcos on Cloud Task 1: User defined blocks The fellows will be working on user defined blocks where they will work on JavaScript and HTML. Make simultaneous pop ups for collecting data from user and getting that data in data structure format by using already created Xcos's JS function and then converting it to XML which is compatible to Scilab's Xcos. Testing these blocks with examples. Task 2: Upgrade import diagram feature Working on import function of Xcos-on-cloud project where blocks used in Xcos diagram will maintain/retain the parameters values of every block as given by user and should not get initialised to default values. Task 3: Draggable graph pop up Fellows will be working on blocks like LOOKUP_f and CURV_f, where they have to make draggable graph i.e. the points of graph can be changed by dragging those points on desirable (x,y) position and the output of that block will change accordingly. On click to blocks pop up opens up with graph window which has draggable points and user can change the graph values and new updated values will get updated in xml. Scilab Toolboxes FOSSEE Optimization Toolbox: Fellows will work on toolbox upgradation. They will also work on making the upgraded toolbox work seamlessly on a Windows platform. It will also be explored if Google OR tools and ECOS (conic solver library) can be added to the toolbox. The other team will work on developing more and better examples for the existing toolbox functions. They will also work on the documentation, bug fixing and completing the spoken tutorial scripts made by previous contributors. FOSSEE Signal Processing Toolbox: The fellows will work on improving the documentation of the existing functions in the current toolbox. One fellow will work on fixing the non-working functions and develop test-cases for the required ones. He/ She will also be asked to use https://travis-ci.org/ for better version control and testing of the codes. One (or two) fellow(s) will be assigned to work on the “Communication Systems Toolbox” and take it to a better level. The fellows will also be given some application-based problems, which might be solved using FOSSEE Signal Processing Toolbox. Scilab2C Toolbox: The fellows will test the entire toolbox to identify a fault/bug and fix the same. They will work on adding support for symbolic functions such as z and s. They will also work on allowing variables with an unknown output size. The scilab colon operator will be added to the toolbox support. Problems with porting C to Arduino platform will be addressed. Usage of Open Modelica will be explored and compared for generating C code from a model. OpenPLC The fellows will be responsible for completing small amount of work that is remaining for Advanced Simulation Dialog of ldmicro. viz Saving the component drawings in advanced simulation dialog in a file, and retrieving the saved diagram on opening. Apart from this, they will be responsible for porting the entire ldmicro software to linux(Ubuntu) environment. The core functionality of the software is easily portable to linux. Designing a UI for the software is a challenge as the original developer of ldmicro (Jonathan Westhues) wishes to use a native gui for linux which is not available for Ubuntu. The task is to design a framework for the software using Xwindow system which is close to being native. eSim Circuit simulation The fellows will be working on adding libraries to eSim using subcircuit builder and device modeling. The newly added libraries has to be demonstrated with a circuit simulation example and has to be documented as a part of eSim user manual.

Aryan Gupta Gurukula Kangri Vishwavidyalaya, Haridwar Python, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2021 The quality of work generated with respect to the assigned task is very good. My mentor Mr. Ansari was very helpful, cooperative, and experienced. I would also like to acknowledge the help, motivation, and future thinking of my colleague Mr. Swaroop which helped in efficient development and effective communication. The internship experience has helped me in deciding my further professional career. Personally, I always wanted to play a major role in application development. Thankfully FOSSEE provided me with a platform for the Osdag module development. The development of FLOSS tools will definitely play a pivotal role in India's development. Rutvik Nitin Joshi Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, Mumbai Osdag, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2021 When I entered college, I had the least required knowledge of computers as I never liked to use a computer/ laptop. Even transferring files from the pen drive was a big task for me. In college, I started to learn different software and due to COVID, my use of computers increased a lot. I was forced to work on a laptop. Due to this, I learned different software which was helpful in chemical engineering. ( ex: Aspen plus, Aspen flare system analyser, dwsim, IMSDesign etc.) When I heard of FOSSEE semester-long internship through my friends, I applied for it and submitted the screening task. When I was selected, I was so happy. The internship was also out of my comfort zone! I had to use Modelica language to create a Property package and function. I am not good at writing codes but due to the help of Harsha sir and Bharvi, I did it. I also learned a lot in DWSIM from Priyam sir. For my every doubt, Priyam sir organized a google meet and taught me. I got to learn a new feature in each meeting. Also, I completed my schooling in Gujarati medium school. In this internship, I had to interact in English, which improved my English speaking skills. This was the additional benefit of this internship for me. This internship has given me a very good platform. I would like to thank fossee team for conducting this internship program. Naik Yutika Niralkumar Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology, Surat DWSIM, OpenModelica, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2021 The internship opportunity was a great learning experience. I consider myself fortunate to get this opportunity. I got exposure to open-source software and culture. This gave me exposure to the work environment, development process and much more. Most of my coding experience had been centered around personal/group projects or assignments for college. These tend to be very specific to their intended audience and generally aren't very consequential to the wider community. In this internship we had to work as a team. The toolbox had a wide reach and was maintained by many people which made me feel like my work was consequential, and that made it feel worthwhile. This internship program helped me gain important knowledge on various aspects of software development. In the beginning I was confused about a few mathematical and technical terms related to the task. I could understand those terms and figure out possible solutions by brainstorming with my peers and mentors and researching on the internet. I gained more proficiency in languages such as C++, Scilab, MATLAB. I learned to write and test programs in AMPL, theoretical concepts related to optimization, Travis CI, and also got a chance to explore a large codebase. My team members collaborated well and my mentors were very helpful. I got to learn something from everyone. My team members gave some insights or other approaches for the same code and my mentors guided me in every possible way. In a nutshell, this internship has been an excellent and rewarding experience. I can conclude that there have been a lot I’ve learnt and much more to explore. This has certainly helped in improving my coding skills in terms of testing, developing and debugging. I will strive to use gained skills and knowledge in the best possible way, and I will continue to work on their improvement, in order to attain desired career objectives. In the end, I would like to thank and appreciate everyone including my mentors, Ashutosh sir and Rupak sir and my team members who made my fellowship a superb learning and memorable experience. Sharvani Laxmi Somayaji National Institute of Technology, Karnataka Scilab Toolbox Development, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2021 My overall experience was great. I should say that FOSSEE is doing very great work in developing open-source tools for the young generation of the country. The guidance given by my mentor was very top-notch. He helped and clarified our doubts, no matter at which time we asked it. I really feel privileged to work under him for my internship. It was a good learning experience even though it was remote. I wish the FOSSEE team all the best for putting their efforts and in achieving their targets. N Swaroop SASTRA University, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu Osdag, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2021 It was a wonderful and exciting 4 months. I have learned how to write analyze and critically think to code efficiently for unit operations and integrated theoretical knowledge learned through the courses in university with hands on practical approach. My mentors and guide helped me every step of the way and I am forever grateful for this experience. Aniruddh Mukunth SASTRA University, Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu OpenModelica, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2021 I really enjoyed my internship of approximately two months. Apart from technical knowledge soft skills such as Team work, Self-Discipline , Time-management and Professionalism were the key skills gained. There was smooth on-boarding process into the internship and very Happy to successfully complete it. Dolon Mandal National Institute of Technology, Agartala Web Development, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2020 Good experience. Even though in-person would have been a better experience, I thank the FOSSEE team for undertaking the challenges and providing this fellowship virtually. The guidance by mentors was timely and good. I learned new things that I wouldn't have learned while working on personal projects. All in all, it was a nice 6-weeks work experience. Krithik Vaidya National Institute of Technology, Surathkal Spoken Tutorial Event Logs and Analytics System, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2020 I think the whole work flow was highly professional and systematic. Every thing was informed via Whatsapp Group or Google Groups. This helped revisit information anytime if missed and needed again. The mentors were exceptionally supportive and poise during the whole program and would help solve queries in the best ways they can. They would also provide some challenges on the group, which they were facing. Instead of assigning these challenges to a particular fellow, they would post it on the group. This made sure that any fellow interested/capable can give their ideas/view on solving the problem. I loved solving these challenges a lot. I myself solved few of those challenges. Also, a prior explanation was provided about the tasks assigned to make the task more understandable and easy to view from the consumer perspective. The best part about the fellowship was the coordination of the team. Each fellow would be assigned a task, which would require them to work along with another fellow and work together on the same thing. Making one fellow do some part and another, the other. Also solving problems was provided ease by the peers, many times another fellow would have faced a problem and would help the other on the same. This sped up the development processes saving from long hours of internet probes.Finally I'd like to congratulate the whole FOSSEE team and IIT Bombay on their wonderful program and thank them for providing me with the priviledge of going through this experience even in such tough times, remotely. Thank you Satyam Singh Niranjan KIET Group of Institutions, Ghaziabad Osdag, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2020 I enjoyed virtual internship. As our country is suffering from pandemic where people are loosing their interns and jobs.I appreciate Fossee to provide internship opportunity. In this project I had no team. This made me realizing the importance of team work. The guidance provided by my mentors helped me to understand concepts , increased my perception level of building and viewing software from scratch. I even lost my focus as I was unable to implement front-end part. My mentors motivated me. My topic was employer recommendation system. I was just having an idea and theoretical knowledge. This intern helped me to implement it . Harshit Jain National Institute of Technology, Agartala Employer Recommendation System, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2020 when I got the FOSSEE fellowship then I really didn't know more about CFD and OpenFOAM, but through the FOSSEE fellowship case study I got a chance to know more about the OpenFOAM & CFD not only CFD &OpenFOAM but also how to write a report and how to present my work through the ppt and the most important thing is the procedure of research. for this purpose, all the three mentors along with the professor and manager are really helpful. without there contribution, I can not learn those things. Shouvik Ghorui Jadavpur university, Kolkata OpenFOAM, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2020 My mentors were very welcoming by nature. There's a saying that goes, ""The first experience is the best experience"", and rightfully so it is and for me it has. Right from the beginning, our project had many issues to work upon and we gave our utmost to get the expected result. To get this done, our mentors constantly supported and cheered us so that we don't lose ourselves down. Initially, we had only learnt the basics of FLOSS to get the fellowship, and once we were through, we saw an ocean of opportunities to work upon with the FLOSS, and we were explained about the everything clearly. Keeping the practical approach in mind, the fellowship was the path where it made us industry-ready. Overall, I would describe my fellowship experience as an enriching and rewarding one. M.Sai Anand Kalasalingam Academy of Research and Education, Srivilliputhur, Tamil Nadu R, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2020 The overall experience was 8/10. The idea behind the work assigned is extremely helpful for students, and even helps the fellows attain more knowledge and understand how many complex topics can be explained in such a simple manner! The mentors assigned to us: Sharanya Achut and Purusharth Saxena guided us very well, informed us about various sources from where we could gain more knowledge, and helped us continuously for various problems, from setting up Manim, to a lot more! I am grateful for this opportunity and do hope we cross paths again! Thank you. Saarth Deshpande Institute of Computer Technology, Pune Mathematics using Python, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2020 Over coming challenges were the real privileges as it was remotely conducted fellowship we didn’t had any team based task but this helped us to know our capabilities and accelerated the growth exponentially which greatly aid in my endeavour.It also helped me to understand the very new way of working and being productive. The mentors were really supportive and their belief on us and guidance helped us excel because of which we were able to complete the task on timely manner and produced a quality work.We are greatly indebted to their precious guidance without which it could not be possible. I learned many things during the course of fellowship and motivated towards usability of Free Open Source Software in my case it was Scilab and Xcos. The best part of the fellowship was when we were asked to prove the concept which we applied in our task over large sample set and justify the output. As this shows the commitment of the whole team of which I am glad I could be part of for producing quality work. Kshitiz IIIT Senapati, Manipur Scilab , FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2020 I was always keen to be a part of the FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, it allowed me to gain a new skill-set with DevOps and work on several Open-Source projects at the same time. Along with the help to solve problems most efficiently, my mentors always gave me transparent feedback about my work and suggested alternatives to opt for while implementing a new concept which encouraged me to understand as well as explore the topic thoroughly. Apart from quality learning and tracking the progress of intern I loved the culture of maintaining a perfect balance between work and breaks during the fellowship. Akshat Pande Amity University, Lucknow Web Development, FOSSEE Summer Fellowship, 2020 In addition to the main task given i also worked on an additional task given by my mentors and am actually happy that i took up that work.I could learn more about the software which i worked and also other programming languages like VHDL to finish my tasks.So the whole experience of learning and implementing to finish our work was great.Our mentors were there helping and clearing our doubts throughout the day.As it was remote fellowship where we had twice or more meetings also in a week where our work would be evaluated and further suggestions would be given.So am very happy and sure that experience and knowledge of hardware language i gained here will help me even after this fellowship.

The FOSSEE team will contact the selected candidates through emails soon. Screening Task: Python Test and Debugging Smart Contracts in Solidity NOTE: This task has been divided in two parts. It is mandatory to complete both the parts as described below for this screening task to be considered as completed. Both the parts are independent of each other, so you can attempt either of them first. Part A: Online Test on Python The test will be available starting from 15th January 2020 Go to https://yaksh.fossee.in/exam Click on New User - Sign Up Button and register using the same Email as used on Moodle In the Search Course Text box, Type in blkchain2020 and click on the Search button You will be able to see the course “Blockchain 2020” Click on the Enroll button beside the Course Name Click on the Start Button On the Course Modules Details Page, click on Start beside the First Task - Python Test Module. On the Module Page, you can start the test by clicking on the Green Start Button Important Note: The test can be taken at any time/day from 15th January 2020 to 25th February 2020 The test has a duration of 45 minutes The test consists of 5 Questions Each Question is a Coding Question which you have to answer using Python Code. Do not attempt to copy, cheat or Google your answers as all submissions are recorded and validated. The test can only be attempted once, candidates will not be allowed to attempt the Quiz more than once under any circumstances The Quiz is completely online and hence you are requested to attempt the Quiz while in a comfortable place with good Internet Connection (Issues arising due to Bad Internet Connection will not be entertained) Part B: Debugging Smart Contracts in Solidity In this screening task we are going to look at your troubleshooting, debugging, explaining and overall Solidity skills. Below are three Solidity contracts. Each of them has one or more bugs, programming errors, security vulnerabilities in it, or perhaps even something that we overlooked. Do not stop at the first error you find. That might for instance mean that types are being wrongly cast, values are not being checked, variables not being handled properly or the functioning of the contract would in some edge cases not work as expected. Or anything else really. Feel free to use any tools, such as browser solidity, but work on your own. Do not believe that they are ranked in ascending order of difficulty. Submission Procedure: Please describe as good as you can the bug(s), and point out solutions on how they could be fixed. Do not just drop ""fixed"" contracts, we want to see your thought process. Please write all your answers in a single Markdown file named after your username ex: Parag_Tiwari.md , which you then upload on moodle. Write your name and email id at the top to further reduce the risk of mis-attribution. Exercise 1 In this contract, the specs are such that value that is sent by the owner is being stored only if it is sent by the owner. It is returned in full when the contract is destroyed after the owner, and only the owner, sends the password to the kill function. This contract has already been deployed, so keep the pragma as it is. pragma solidity 0.4.19; contract PiggyBank { address owner; uint248 balance; bytes32 hashedPassword; function piggyBank ( bytes32 _hashedPassword) { owner = msg . sender ; balance += uint248 ( msg . value ); hashedPassword = _hashedPassword; } function () payable { if ( msg . sender != owner) revert (); balance += uint248 ( msg . value ); } function kill ( bytes32 password) { if ( keccak256 (owner, password) != hashedPassword) revert (); selfdestruct (owner); } } Exercise 2 In this contract, a shop system processes a payment, sends the payment to a wallet contract and then instructs the warehouse to ship the purchase. What could go wrong? pragma solidity ^0.4.5; interface WarehouseI { function setDeliveryAddress ( string where); function ship ( uint id, address customer) returns ( bool handled); } contract Store { address wallet; WarehouseI warehouse; function Store ( address _wallet, address _warehouse) { wallet = _wallet; warehouse = WarehouseI(_warehouse); } function purchase ( uint id) returns ( bool success) { wallet. send ( msg . value ); return warehouse.ship(id, msg . sender ); } } Exercise 3 In this contract, every value sent to the fallback function is supposed to be equally split between account one, account two and the contract itself. Beside finding out problems with it, how could an attacker game this contract and what would be the end result? Additionally, please provide a working example of an attacker. pragma solidity ^0.4.9; contract Splitter { address one; address two; function Splitter ( address _two) { if ( msg . value > 0 ) revert (); one = msg . sender ; two = _two; } function () payable { uint amount = address ( this ). balance / 3 ; require (one. call . value (amount)()); require (two. call . value (amount)()); } } Resources to learn Solidity: Solidity — Solidity 0.5.3 documentation Solidity in Depth — Solidity 0.6.1 documentation Solidity by Example — Solidity 0.5.3 documentation Evaluation Criteria : Successfully passing the FOSSEE Fellowship Python Test Debugging Smart Contracts submissions will be evaluated for correctness and uniqueness and top entries will be shortlisted.

Submission steps and deadline will be mentioned in the problem statement for each toolbox. No reminder regarding the test or submission deadline will be sent. No project proposal is required for this project. Scilab-Julia Interface (Mentor: Shamika, Openings: 1, Honorarium: 10000) Difficulty level: Easy Create an interface that can call any Julia function from Scilab console and displays the output of the Julia function on Scilab console. Applicant profile: The applicant should Have excellent coding skills in C and C++ Know how to call functions from external libraries in C/C++ code Know how to compile C/C++ code by linking against external libraries Suggested reading: Scilab API: https://help.scilab.org/docs/5.5.2/en_US/section_204636e951f595409bc6782bb8e1d2d9.html Embedding Julia in C: http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.4/manual/embedding/ Application Procedure: Submit a project proposal following WnCC SoC guidelines and deadline. Scilab Video player (Mentor: Shamika, Openings: 1, Honorarium: 10000) Difficulty level: Easy Create a native video player for Scilab. It should have all the basic features found in any video player- play, pause, stop, rewind and forward. Application Procedure: Submit a project proposal following WnCC SoC guidelines and deadline. Scilab server (Mentor: Srikant , Shamika, Openings: 2, Honorarium: 50000 per person) Scilab Textbook Companion (TBC) is one of the flagship activities undertaken by FOSSEE. It is a collection of code for each solved example of a standard textbook. We have active Scilab and Python TBCs. Students and faculty of colleges have created more than 500 Scilab TBC and a similar number of Python TBC. As there are about 50,000 scripts in 500 TBCs, it becomes a valuable resource for documentation, function usage search and also as a subject learning material. More details could be fetched from here . Unlike other scripting languages, Scilab loads a huge set of libraries in the background. Thus a single instance causes considerable consumption of computer resources.This would create a problem if we want to have parallel instances of Scilab. We have thought of a couple of solutions to this problem. Fixing the Scilab core to only load libraries which are called in the program at the run time. Developing an atoms module to accept code from various threads and pipe them to a single Scilab instance. The atoms module shall do the following: It should decode communication packet(code) received from user Execute Scilab code in a protected environment Return the result/error to the user Clear the Scilab memory In the case of overloading on a single Scilab instance, there should be an intermediate program to monitor and initiate a new Scilab instance. This autoscaling operation should happen seamlessly. The autoscaling program should keep track of user requests. Xcos on web (Mentor: Inderpreet , Dipti, Openings: 2 , Honorarium: 50000 per person) The objective of Xcos on web project is to provide access to the capabilities of Xcos simulator over web. Upon the completion of this project, the users with web-enabled devices will be able to load, create and simulate Xcos diagrams through a web browser. This project has been partially completed and available here . The current implementation framework is as follows. Overall system design – Design of browser based Xcos simulator to include editor, several menu options, palette libraries, simulation options, etc. Graphical User Interface – Provision of palette blocks in the left pane, set scope parameters and right click functionalities, port constraints for the simulator blocks, Tooltip and color wheel features, Set context option, etc. Data Structures – To enable relevant function call for each block dragged and dropped on the browser-based editor followed by setting the values of model, graphics, GUI and docs; Mapping of Xcos blocks' sci files to JavaScript XSLT (eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) – Use of a style sheet language to convert XML generated by GUI into Scilab compatible XML Parser – Conversion of data structures to JavaScript using regex in Python Server – Xcos file after suitable conversion is sent to the server for computation and simulation and the results are brought back at the user end in the form of images Technologies used: mxGraph, XSLT, JavaScript, Python, Java Servlet, NGINX, Apache Tomcat The code is available here . Building a Generic Remote Triggered Virtual Lab Interface (Mentor: Dipti, Inderpreet, Openings: 1, Honorarium: 30000) A Virtual Laboratory is an online facility aimed at providing a laboratory experience to students. Unlike Simulation Virtual Labs, Remote Triggered Virtual Labs (RT labs for short) is that category of Virtual Labs which enables the student to access a real experimental setup, remotely. One such facility is available for a laboratory setup known as “Single Board Heater System”, SBHS for short. The SBHS RT lab can be accessed at http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/sbhs/ To understand what is SBHS, see the spoken tutorial available here http://goo.gl/lYdhRi . If you want to quickly learn how to access SBHS RT labs see http://goo.gl/vs5P9d A good documentation on this is available at http://sbhs.fossee.in/downloads under the “Documentation” section. The document contains a dedicated chapter which attempts to explain the Client-Server architecture. Shortcomings in the current solution: The solution is very specific to SBHS experimental setup. The architecture cannot work without re-writing a few modules if there is even a slight change in the hardware. There are some known software bugs which make a few SBHS unusable. These bugs are random and are currently unsolved. It has very less admin specific features. Problem Statement: You are expected to come up with a more generic solution for RT labs in general. The solution should be robust, low on maintenance, automated and easily adaptable for a new hardware experimental setup, with minimum changes in the code. You may think of a central interface to customise the web solution as per the new hardware. For example, a number of inputs-outputs, protocol etc. The solution should have all the features of the existing SBHS RT lab solution. You can propose better alternatives, though. The solution has to be well documented with a regular version controlling/ backup setup. The admin should have easy interfaces to do health checkup of the hardware(s), bypassing all the user rules and also should be able to download users experimental data files based on the slot date-time value. Basically, the admin should have an easy control over the server without being a domain expert. Develop GUI for OpenModelica using Python (Mentor: Rahul, Openings: 2, Honorarium: 25000 per person) Job Description We are looking for a python developer with experience in GUI development. You will be working on a project that involves developing a GUI, for a chemical process simulator, in python using kivy ( https://kivy.org/ ). The work includes designing, developing and testing various GUI functionalities like menubars, taskbars, drag and drop, popups etc. This GUI will then be interfaced with OpenModelica ( https://openmodelica.org/ ), which will serve as a simulation engine for the GUI. The interface will be majorly based on making system calls from python using the package os ( https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.html ). Therefore, part of the work will be dedicated to the development of the above mentioned interface. Job Requirements 1. Good python programming skills. 2. Familiar with GUI concepts. 3. Experience in Tkinter or PyQt is preferred. 4. Good understanding of OOPs. Improving SBHS remote-triggered virtual lab server and website (Mentor: Rupak, Inderpreet, Openings: 2 , Honorarium: 30 000) A Virtual Laboratory is an online facility aimed at providing an laboratory experience to students. Unlike Simulation Virtual Labs, Remote Triggered Virtual Labs (RT labs for short) is that category of Virtual Labs which enables the student to access a real experimental setup, remotely. One such facility is available for a laboratory setup known as “Single Board Heater System”, SBHS for short. The SBHS RT lab can be accessed at http://vlabs.iitb.ac.in/sbhs/ To understand what is SBHS, see the spoken tutorial available here http://goo.gl/lYdhRi . If you want to quickly learn how to access SBHS RT labs see http://goo.gl/vs5P9d . A good documentation/manual on this is available at http://sbhs.fossee.in/downloads under the “Documentation” section. The document contains a dedicated chapter which attempts to explain the Client-Server architecture. A few bugs/features to be addressed: There are two main bugs which result in ""no connection"" to the server and ""no communication"" with the hardware. They have to be identified and resolved. An admin interface is required where he/she can carry out certain tests and check for the server health, easily. For example, there has to be a web facility for the admin to test a particular SBHS and acquire the results, bypassing the common user rules. An admin interface is also required to check all webcams. An admin interface is also required to download users data files based on slot date-time. Needs test cases to check the server functionality. Some Version Controlling issues have to be fixed. Automated health monitoring has to be implemented to remove the non-working SBHS units and report to admin. The current server handles all the load, including hardware interface.

Currently, we at FOSSEE, have used a combination of open-source software Python scripts and Blender, to build a prototype GUI. We would like to build on this and extend the capability of this GUI. Currently, the GUI is built so that it is able to solve 1 fluid-based problem (a tutorial). We would like to extend the GUI's capability to act as the front end through which users can solve 10 more problems that we have in our repository. Previously coded modules will be made available to enable the extension of this GUI. The intern will work largely in the Python and Blender environments under the guidance of the Python and the OpenFOAM FOSSEE teams. Proficiency in Python is important, and familiarity with Blender is preferred. No of interns: 2 Qualifications: BE/B.tech, ME/M.Tech Field of Engineering: Third-year/Final year student (B.E / B.

Number of Interns: 3-4 Project Name : OpenFOAM GUI Project Details : The CFD-FOSSEE team is developing a GUI application (as a Blender Addon) to alleviate the effort of constructing OpenFOAM cases. This involves creating UI widgets to compose cellshapes into complex multi-block geometries, graphical manipulation of solver parameters, exporting/importing OpenFOAM dictionaries and developing ancillary features for convenient usage. With this internship, we intend to expand current capabilities of the GUI and incorporate new features to address CFD problems of higher complexity. Ultimately, the GUI is envisioned to be a black box that envelopes OpenFOAM to relieve the user from defining verbose case dictionaries without compromising the extent of user control. Qualification : Students pursuing B.E./B.Tech/M.Tech who seek to apply their programming skills in the development of scientific software. While having a background in Mechanical Engineering/Aerospace Engineering or related fields with programming skills is preferable, we also consider students from other areas (CS, IT, EE, ECE etc.) eager to partake in interdisciplinary research. Having prior knowledge of OpenFOAM and/or CFD can give you an edge over the applicants. We encourage you to learn and implement a solution even if you do not have prior knowledge. Learning Resources : Documentation on Blender’s Python API, application modules and standalone modules are available on their official website . Spoken Tutorials on CFD with OpenFOAM are available here . There are plenty of online resources available on the internet to learn Python including Python Spoken Tutorials . Minimum Skill Set : Good coding skills and understanding of object oriented concepts in Python and related libraries (numpy, SciPy, pyvista). Familiarity with Blender and the Blender Python API (bpy) and Blender’s mesh accessibility module (bmesh). Must be good at undergrad level applied math. Preferred Skill Set : Problem solving ability, writing well-structured code in Python, C++ and implementing software design patterns. Should know to parse data-serialization formats (YAML or JSON).

Strong knowledge of mathematics, particularly in 3D geometry and numerical methods. Sound understanding of data structures (Trees, Graphs) and GUI development (preferably in PyQt, pyside). Skills in implementing algorithms related to computational geometry (3D transformations, Splines, NURBS, Surface mesh generation, curve fitting, interpolation methods, BVH Trees). Experience of CFD with OpenFOAM. Must know how to use Git. Number of Interns : 2 Screening task details : Create a Blender Add-On that contains 3 'feature sets' and a supplementary feature. Each feature set should be a UI panel. The feature sets progress in difficulty level. Ensure to mention the version of Blender being used by the addon in bl_info at the top of your addon.py file or __init__.py file. Following are the expectations from the feature sets: Feature Set 1: Summon Cubes (Difficulty: Easy) Create a UI Panel with an integer input box that accepts only a natural composite number (N) < 50. If a prime number is entered then display a simple pop-up with the message: “ N must be composite ”. Create a button within the UI panel that evenly distributes N cubes (of side length = 1 meter) into a 2D array of size (m x n) in the 3D viewport. m, n are the number of cubes along the axes of the 2D array. Create another button to delete selected cube(s). Example case: If N is 48, then you can create a 2D array of 6 cubes x 8 cubes i.e. m=6, n=8 or 4 cubes x 12 cubes i.e. m=4, n=12. The factors of N i.e. m, n are your choice. Feature Set 2: Curve Fitting (Difficulty: Moderate) Append the UI panel with 3 integer input boxes (A, w, n). A, w defines the amplitude and frequency of a sine wave along the X axis with n being the number of points forming the sine wave. Make a button to construct a sine wave of amplitude A and frequency w in the 3D Viewport by joining the n points with straight lines. Hint: explore blender gpu module/bgl module for this. Feature Set 3: Surface Mesh (Difficulty: Hard) Make a button to create a surface mesh of a paraboloid (z = x 2 + y 2 for z < 8 meter) in the 3D viewport. Choose an adequate number of points to make a smooth surface. Hint: create a point cloud belonging to the surface and mesh it. Meshing methods can be found in class bpy.types.Mesh. Supplementary Feature: Blender-PyQt App Create a PyQt app that displays your name and a file browser to select an image file (of any format). Create a QPushButton that displays the image under-neath your name. Add a button within the UI panel that opens the PyQt app. Suggestions : Follow PEP8 coding standards. Write well-structured, modular and documented code. You'll certainly impress us if you write tests for your programs. Think about edge cases and try writing error free code.

"Introducing FOSSEE Animations: Lecture notes and Animations for Undergraduate Mathematics | FOSSEE FOSSEE | Home User banner adv Home Statistics About Contact FOSSEE Club FOSSEE Awards Testimonials Resources Teaching Support Join Us Internships Winter Internship FOSSEE ICFOSS Internship Semester-Long Internships Summer Fellowship GIS Internship Events Podcasts Introducing FOSSEE Animations: Lecture notes and Animations for Undergraduate Mathematics Submitted by mathanimations on Fri, 09/11/2020 - 15:32 Geometric intuition is the ability to solve and/or reason out non-geometric problems in geometric ways . Now, there have been numerous derby matches on rigour vs intuition (especially in mathematics). We’ll try to stray away from recapitulation, but instead, stand on the shoulder of giants . The famous British mathematician Ian Stewart had said, “ Intuitive feeling invoked by a picture can, with a little care, be turned into a logically satisfactory mathematical proof that the theorem is true - and because it appeals to intuition, it’s a very convincing proof ”. But what if we could somehow extend it beyond just a static picture? Things do become delightfully interesting, to say the least. One good thing about visualizing mathematics is that it simplifies the complexity. For instance, we can break down an abstract topic into a series of steps - reducing the reliance on prerequisites. The intention here is not to forgo the rigour completely, but instead, make it a bit more rewarding with some visual treats - to look at analysis from the eyes of geometry. This approach was inspired by Grant Sanderson (creator of 3b1b and the python package manim) - in fact, most of the animations created under this project are made with manim. “ FOSSEE Animations | Math ” is a FOSSEE project based in IIT Bombay. The project consists of a repository of lecture notes on selected math topics created for students, by students. (i.e all the notes and animations are created by the students as a part of an internship/fellowship) -- BUT that’s not the end of it - apart from being typical lecture notes, mathematically cogent animations are also present to complement the notes (lecture notes on steroids?). These lecture notes closely follow a specific structure: Definition / Theorem Motivation Bird’s Eye View - a simplified overview of the topic, essentially explains the main points of the topic in a simplified (non-rigorous) manner. Context of the Definition - expands on the topic and, more importantly, explains the what and the why of the theorem/definition. Typically involves breaking down the theorem/definition into smaller pieces and explaining the pieces individually. For example, why is differentiability of a single-variable function defined on an open set and not a closed set? Applications Pause and Ponder - offers “food for thought” on the given topic History / References / Further Reading Over the course of this summer (2020), we curated a repository of around many such lecture notes ranging from Transformations to Multivariable calculus. These notes were created by the amazing fellows from the FOSSEE Summer Fellowship 2020. Again, the idea behind this concept is that the animations will be complementary to the notes, giving a well-formed geometrical intuition about the mathematical theory. The process of creating such notes is rather exhaustive, with multiple revisions and reviews - around 3-5 reviews with the mentors and one round of discussion with Prof. Ramachandran. Moreover, before finalizing the notes, they also go through another round of review with a few other professors from IIT Bombay. The fellows have also shown appreciation to this process as they improved their pedagogical writing which in turn would be helpful for the anonymous reader. In terms of numbers, during the Fellowship, we curated 50+ lecture notes with 200+ animations. These notes are primarily focused on first/second year undergraduate mathematics curriculum, specifically Linear Algebra, Calculus of Several Variables, and Series & Transformations. And, since these notes are created by students, we certainly have some more opportunities in the bag. While the Summer Fellowship takes place once a year, last year we also gave an internship on Real Analysis - with more planned in the future. The internships follow the same model as the fellowship. The outreach programs also include workshops on Animating Math, where libraries like Manim and Mayavi are introduced along with the general principles of curating explanatory animations are discussed. Tl;dr: The FOSSEE Animations project works on simplifying the complex topics through animations. This is done by numerous students who take part in the internship and/or fellowship. The lecture notes are available at math.animations.fossee.in and attempts to present the reader with a blend of both the algebraic and geometric approach. mathanimations's blog Log in to post comments POSTER BROCHURE CONTACT FOSSEE, IIT Bombay Mumbai, India Phone : (+91) 22 25764111 Email : info [at] fossee [dot] in This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License",https://fossee.in/node/80

One of the main objectives of this conference is to motivate good engineering graduates to continue to work in the core sector. The conference proceedings contain the work presented by students, faculty and industry participants during the conference as well as flowsheets and their abstracts from DWSIM flowsheeting project. There are two chapters in proceedings. The first chapter presents 10 papers written by students and faculty of top engineering institutions in India. There is also one paper from an industry group. Ten of them are based on open source process simulator DWSIM and one uses OpenModelica. The academic participants have shared their flowsheet as well. Students who contributed these papers familiarised themselves with DWSIM or OpenModelica, as the case may be, and simulated their systems. In the second chapter, we provide a brief summary of 100 flowsheets, created mainly by students and faculty of top chemical engineering departments in India. All of them have been solved using the state of the art Free and Open Source Simulator (FOSS) DWSIM. Most of them have also compared their results with that from a commercial equivalent. We have also given a link for every flowsheet, from which, one may download and make use of the flowsheet. Click here to view the proceedings of NCCPS-2018.

For any queries, please mail us at contact-cfd@fossee.in . Number of Interns: 3-4 Project Name : OpenFOAM GUI Project Details : The CFD-FOSSEE team is developing a GUI application (as a Blender Addon) to alleviate the effort of constructing OpenFOAM cases. This involves creating UI widgets to compose cellshapes into complex multi-block geometries, graphical manipulation of solver parameters, exporting/importing OpenFOAM dictionaries and developing ancillary features for convenient usage. With this internship, we intend to expand current capabilities of the GUI and incorporate new features to address CFD problems of higher complexity. Ultimately, the GUI is envisioned to be a black box that envelopes OpenFOAM to relieve the user from defining verbose case dictionaries without compromising the extent of user control. Qualification : Students pursuing B.E./B.Tech/M.Tech who seek to apply their programming skills in the development of scientific software. While having a background in Mechanical Engineering/Aerospace Engineering or related fields with programming skills is preferable, we also consider students from other areas (CS, IT, EE, ECE etc.) eager to partake in interdisciplinary research. Having prior knowledge of OpenFOAM and/or CFD can give you an edge over the applicants. We encourage you to learn and implement a solution even if you do not have prior knowledge. Learning Resources : Documentation on Blender’s Python API, application modules and standalone modules are available on their official website . Spoken Tutorials on CFD with OpenFOAM are available here . There are plenty of online resources available on the internet to learn Python including Python Spoken Tutorials . Minimum Skill Set : Good coding skills and understanding of object oriented concepts in Python and related libraries (numpy, SciPy, pyvista). Familiarity with Blender and the Blender Python API (bpy) and Blender’s mesh accessibility module (bmesh). Must be good at undergrad level applied math. Preferred Skill Set : Problem solving ability, writing well-structured code in Python, C++ and implementing software design patterns. Should know to parse data-serialization formats (YAML or JSON). Experience with Blender (bpy, bmesh), OpenGL and standalone modules Blender-OpenGL Wrapper (bgl), Blender GPU module (gpu). Strong knowledge of mathematics, particularly in 3D geometry and numerical methods. Sound understanding of data structures (Trees, Graphs) and GUI development (preferably in PyQt, pyside). Skills in implementing algorithms related to computational geometry (3D transformations, Splines, NURBS, Surface mesh generation, curve fitting, interpolation methods, BVH Trees). Experience of CFD with OpenFOAM. Must know how to use Git. Number of Interns : 2 Screening task details : Create a Blender Add-On that contains 3 'feature sets' and a supplementary feature. Each feature set should be a UI panel. The feature sets progress in difficulty level. Ensure to mention the version of Blender being used by the addon in bl_info at the top of your addon.py file or __init__.py file. Following are the expectations from the feature sets: Feature Set 1: Summon Cubes (Difficulty: Easy) Create a UI Panel with an integer input box that accepts only a natural composite number (N) < 50. If a prime number is entered then display a simple pop-up with the message: “ N must be composite ”. Create a button within the UI panel that evenly distributes N cubes (of side length = 1 meter) into a 2D array of size (m x n) in the 3D viewport. m, n are the number of cubes along the axes of the 2D array. Create another button to delete selected cube(s). Example case: If N is 48, then you can create a 2D array of 6 cubes x 8 cubes i.e. m=6, n=8 or 4 cubes x 12 cubes i.e. m=4, n=12. The factors of N i.e. m, n are your choice. Feature Set 2: Curve Fitting (Difficulty: Moderate) Append the UI panel with 3 integer input boxes (A, w, n). A, w defines the amplitude and frequency of a sine wave along the X axis with n being the number of points forming the sine wave. Make a button to construct a sine wave of amplitude A and frequency w in the 3D Viewport by joining the n points with straight lines. Hint: explore blender gpu module/bgl module for this. Feature Set 3: Surface Mesh (Difficulty: Hard) Make a button to create a surface mesh of a paraboloid (z = x 2 + y 2 for z < 8 meter) in the 3D viewport. Choose an adequate number of points to make a smooth surface. Hint: create a point cloud belonging to the surface and mesh it. Meshing methods can be found in class bpy.types.Mesh. Supplementary Feature: Blender-PyQt App Create a PyQt app that displays your name and a file browser to select an image file (of any format). Create a QPushButton that displays the image under-neath your name. Add a button within the UI panel that opens the PyQt app. Suggestions : Follow PEP8 coding standards. Write well-structured, modular and documented code. You'll certainly impress us if you write tests for your programs. Think about edge cases and try writing error free code. Following the hints indicate how well you respond to guidance but there may be multiple ways to solve the screening task. So be creative with your solution. If your solution requires dependencies, then include a requirements.txt in the submission zip file. There is no minimum GPA criteria. Your problem solving ability matters more. Perform the tasks independently as stringent plagiarism checks are followed at FOSSEE. Any malpractice will lead to disqualification. Apply only if you are available for the entire duration of internship. You must also have the minimum hardware requirements to run Blender on your system. Early submission is not an evaluation criteria, however you must adhere to deadlines. Submit your application even if your solution is incomplete. We take a holistic look at your application.
